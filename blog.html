<h2>TapSense Announces Support for Wearables Including the Pebble Smartwatch</h2>

<p><em>SAN FRANCISCO, June 24, 2014</em> - Today, TapSense, the leading independent advertising exchange, announces support for wearables, including the Pebble smartwatch apps. This new feature provides wearable app developers with an entirely new marketing channel, by allowing them to promote their apps directly through the TapSense exchange. You can view a video demo here.</p>

<p>It works by serving an ad to promote a Pebble app. TapSense targets iOS and Android devices that are Pebble smartwatch owners. When a user clicks on the mobile ad for a Pebble app, the ad link will connect directly to the app in the Pebble appstore. Users can then click "Add" to install the advertised Pebble app.</p>

<p>Ash Kumar, CEO and Founder of TapSense, says, "With over 3,000 apps in their store, the Pebble smartwatch demonstrates that the future of the mobile developer ecosystem is with wearables. TapSense has always been committed to providing developers tools to promote and monetize apps. Support for wearables is an important aspect of this and we plan to add support for additional devices, including wearables from third parties like Apple as they are released."</p>

<h2>TapSense Announces Mediation Support for Video Advertising</h2>

<p>Today, TapSense announces support for video mediation on iOS. Using the TapSense Video Mediation solution, Publishers can now tap into video demand from leading video partners to improve their monetization.</p>

<p>Video as an ad format is experiencing strong growth and is increasingly preferred by mobile app publishers due to the high CPMs it offers. On the demand side, several brand advertisers are allocating a larger portion of their budgets to mobile video. Today, about 75% of video ads are delivered through apps, 80% of which are on iOS.
(http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/75-mobile-video-ads-happen-app-157217)</p>

<p>With TapSense Video Mediation, publishers can work with multiple video demand partners at the same time. Mediation allows publishers to dynamically alter their traffic allocation based on their fill rates and eCPMs. Further, publishers automatically get access to brand video demand from the TapSense RTB Marketplace through demand partners, which include agencies, direct advertisers and demand side platforms (DSPs).</p>

<h2>Why the Private RTB Marketplace is the Future of Publisher Monetization</h2>

<p>In spite of its obvious efficiencies, RTB or Real-Time Bidding of ad placements on the PC web continues to be dominated by direct response advertisers buying remnant inventory. While many attempts have been made, premium publishers remain reluctant to put their inventory on public exchanges. They fear a “race to the bottom” in CPMs, as they compete against the sheer volume of impressions thrown off by social media, email and other utility type sites.</p>

<p>In mobile, the RTB ecosystem is evolving differently. New approaches, better technology and smarter implementation methods are emerging that promise to overcome many of the hurdles that RTB still faces on the PC Web. It’s the private marketplace model in particular that’s gaining traction and helping lead the way forward for premium RTB. This set up allows premium publishers to control their inventory and overcome the public RTB exchange pitfalls.</p>

<p>On the public exchange, it’s hard for premium publishers to differentiate. On these exchanges, buyers see their inventory as a small portion of very large pool of low quality impressions. There is little information available to help buyers make decisions. Most RTB exchanges only provide a source URL to define the inventory. This favors the mega providers who have literally billions of impressions they want to offload. Because it’s all happening in real-time, in many cases RTB ends up reducing the value of premium inventory. Conversely, RTB should be increasing inventory value by increasing the competition between buyers.</p>
